# DL-Inference
This is a replication project. The paper can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.04252.pdf). The original source code can be found [here](https://zenodo.org/record/1242583#.WvAmFXUvz80).  
## Requirements to run this project
- *Jupyter Notebook*  
- *Python 2 - 3.7*  
- *Tensorflow 1.3 - 1.15*  
- *MySQL*  
- *sklearn, numpy*  
- *Pyro4*  
## Setup
*Adding image dataset ILSVRC 2012 (50K images) to the project*  

In the value folder (/images/val), **images** (/images/val/**images**/) folder should be created.  
Inside this folder, images sould be placed in such manner: _images/val/images/ILSVRC2012_val_00000001.JPEG_.  
Image dataset (ImageNet LSVRC 2012) can be downloaded [here](https://academictorrents.com/details/5d6d0df7ed81efd49ca99ea4737e0ae5e3a5f2e5) (Click "I accept the terms" and download the torrent file).

*Adding checkpoints for the pre-trained DNNs*  

In the project folder (/), **model_data** (/**model_data**/) folder should be created.  
Inside **/model_data/tensorflow/checkpoints/** folder, three folders should be created: _/inception_v4/_, _/resnet_v1_152/_, _/mobilenet_v1_1.0_224/_.   
Inside these folders, checkpoints should be placed respectively like this: _model_data/tensorflow/checkpoints/inception_v4/inception_v4.cpkt_ (mobilenet will have three files (3 x mobilenet_v1_1.0_224.cpkt.*)).    
Checkpoints can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/slim#pre-trained-models). 
## Running the project
First, the Database Tutorial.ipynb file should be run, and then the CSV Tutorial.ipynb file. After the two CSV files are generated (they are provided here), Cross validating the premodel.ipynb file should be run.
